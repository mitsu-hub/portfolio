  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Selected a static site architecture using GitHub Pages for simplicity, security, and reliability</li>
  <li>Implemented a multi-page structure to separate overview and detailed project content</li>
  <li>Centralized styling to maintain consistency and reduce maintenance effort</li>
  <li>Used a Git-based workflow to manage updates and ensure version control</li>
</ul>


<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Japanese Student Association (JSA) Official Website</h3>
<p><em>Edmonds College | Nov 2025 – Present</em></p>
<p>
This project was my first experience building a website and holds strong personal significance. The Japanese Student Association previously relied primarily on social media for communication, which made it difficult for new students to find reliable and organized information.

To address this issue, I designed and developed an official website to serve as a centralized and accessible information hub for the organization.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed the overall site structure with a strong focus on clarity, readability, and ease of navigation</li>
  <li>Created a layout that allows users to quickly access event information and organizational updates</li>
  <li>Improved the accessibility of official information by providing a stable platform beyond social media</li>
  <li>Took responsibility for delivering a site suitable for publication as an official college-affiliated resource</li>
</ul>

<p>
Through this project, I strengthened both my technical skills and my ability to evaluate my work from an objective, user-focused perspective. 
  Publishing a website associated with the college reinforced a strong sense of responsibility and professionalism, marking an important milestone in my growth as a developer.

  <h3>Personal Web Portfolio & GitHub Pages Deployment</h3>
<p><em>Personal Project | Dec 2025 – Present</em></p>
<p>
Designed and deployed a personal web portfolio using GitHub Pages to professionally showcase projects, technical skills, and academic experience.
The site was structured to function as a central hub linking a resume, portfolio content, and future projects.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designed a multi-page site architecture separating landing, portfolio, and resume content for clarity and scalability</li>
  <li>Deployed and maintained a static website using GitHub Pages with a clean, professional layout</li>
  <li>Implemented consistent styling and navigation to ensure a unified user experience across multiple sections</li>
  <li>Structured content to support future expansion, including additional projects and external links</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages, Git</p>

<h3>Machine Learning–Based Intrusion Detection & Prevention System Evaluation</h3>
<p><em>Kanto Gakuin University | Sep 2022 – Mar 2024</em></p>
<p>
This project represents a two-year research effort that significantly shaped my interest in cybersecurity and my long-term career goals. Driven by a strong interest in Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), 
I conducted an in-depth study to understand how machine learning can be applied to real-world network security challenges.

Using the CICIDS2017 dataset, I implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze their effectiveness in detecting malicious network traffic. 
Through this process, I moved from a surface-level understanding of IDPS concepts to a deep, practical understanding of both their capabilities and limitations.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented and evaluated four machine learning algorithms: 
    Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and k-Nearest Neighbors</li>
  <li>Conducted binary classification experiments focusing on detection accuracy using precision and recall as primary evaluation metrics</li>
  <li>Developed extensive Python-based implementations, writing approximately 10 source files with over 1,000 lines of code each</li>
  <li>Identified gaps between theoretical expectations and real-world model performance, particularly in false positives for normal traffic</li>
  <li>Iteratively refined experiments through continuous trial and error, dedicating significant time to research and experimentation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Through this research, I gained a realistic perspective on the challenges of deploying machine learning–based security systems in operational environments.
The experience fundamentally changed how I view cybersecurity, shifting my focus toward detection accuracy, operational impact, and analyst usability.

This project directly influenced my aspiration to pursue a future role in a Security Operations Center (SOC), where accurate detection and informed decision-making are critical.
